## What is this group about?

The Graduate Council (GC) represents the interests of the CS graduate student body at VT both within the department and outside. We provide an interface between the student body and the faculty memebers, help organize social events among graduate students, and help incoming students become familiar with departmental procedures and activities. Outside the department, we voice student opinions in various graduate school forums and promote social engagements with the wider graduate student community.
