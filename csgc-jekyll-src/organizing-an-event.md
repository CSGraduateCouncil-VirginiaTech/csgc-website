_This page serves as a rough guide for what you (a student) need to do in order to get reimbursed for events you might organize on behalf of the Graduate Student Council._

**Budget**

Once you have decided to host an event, you need to obtain an estimate for how many people are going to attend.
This helps with deciding a budget.
An easy way to do this is to send out a Google Form a week or two in advance.

Once you have an estimated number of attendees, come up with a reasonable budget and contact [Libby Bradford](bradfolg@vt.edu).
She will confirm the budget, among other things.

**Venue**

There are a number of rooms available to the CS Department and to grad students in general.
There are various [meeting rooms](https://graduatelifecenter.vt.edu/space-reservations.html) in the GLC available for different group sizes.
The KnowledgeWorks II building in the CRC also has some rooms available, though you may not get many attendees from the main campus.

**Food**

The CS department works with certain establishments in the Blacksburg area (Moe's, Domino's, Papa John's, Jimmy John's, etc).
These places will bill the department directly, meaning you don't have to bother with reimbursements.
However, you can get get food from some other establishment if you so wish.

To be reimbursed, you need the following:
* An itemized receipt of any expenditures, including for silverware, napkins, etc.
* A **signed** list of attendees (nothing fancy, this can just be a legal pad)
* (preferred) some kind of evidence that the event actually took place as planned
