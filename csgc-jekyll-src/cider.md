## Mission Statement

The [Center for Instructional Development and Educational Research (CIDER)](https://www.cider.vt.edu/) fosters the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of disciplinary and interdisciplinary learner-centered instruction; promotes and recognizes excellence in higher education instruction; supports and conducts research on the scholarship of teaching and learning; and advocates for a campus climate that values educating the whole student through effective, innovative and transformative instruction. 

## What does this mean for graduate students?

It means CIDER is able to provide instructional support! See [here](https://www.cider.vt.edu/support/index.html).

Grad students who are teaching a course are able to seek teaching instruction and evaluation, and help in designing and developing instructional material.
This is especially helpful for students who are teaching for the first time, who would like to know how they are doing, and how they can improve.
