title: About CS Grad Council
---

The Graduate Council (GC) represents the interests of the CS graduate student body both within the department and outside. We represent the student body during faculty meetings within the department, help organize social events among graduate students and aid incoming students become familiar with deparmental procedures and acitivities. Outside the department, we voice student opinions in various graduate school forums and promote social engagements with the wider graduate student community.

Additionally, we manage allocation of travel funds for conference travels, details of which can be found in the page [Travel Funding](/travel_funding/).
