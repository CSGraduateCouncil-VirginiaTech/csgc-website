We are still working the CS department to organize some social events this semester. Please check back later to see if we have updated this page.

For some pointers on organizing an event on behalf of the Grad Council, see [the guide](/events/organizing-an-event).

### Qualifier Q&A and Pizza: Dec. 7, 2017

The CS Grad Council is pleased to invite you to *Qualifier Q&A and Pizza*, so you can learn about the CS PhD qualifying process from students who have already qualified.

- *What*: Qualifier Q&A and Pizza
- *When*: Thursday, December 7, 7-8PM
- *Where*: GLC Room B
- *Food*: We'll be serving pizza, etc. from one of Blacksburg's "upscale" options -- Mellow Mushroom or Beast of Blacksburg.

If you haven't yet taken the qualifier exam, this is a great opportunity to ask questions and to learn from others' experiences.
If you'd like to pass the qualifier on research points, we'll be talking about that too.

For our friends in Northern Virginia, we'll arrange Skype access to the Q&A if anyone is interested.  No remote access to our pizza will be provided.
