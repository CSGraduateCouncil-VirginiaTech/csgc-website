The department has a process in place whereby CS graduate students can request 
partial support from the department for travel to conferences. Requests will be 
reviewed and (mostly) granted on a rolling basis, through a simple survey:

### Policy

Our goal is to help support any student who has a refereed paper or
presentation accepted at a conference **once per fiscal year** (July 1
through June 30). The 1st day of your trip defines which fiscal year it
is in.

Requests for support for additional trips in a given year, or for
conference attendance without a presentation, will be considered but
not necessarily approved in all cases. Senior PhD students, for whom
multiple trips in a year are common, are more likely to receive multiple
funding awards in a given year.

Due to funding constraints, support levels will be limited for now to
**$400 for travel in the US** and **$600 for international travel**.  So getting
support from other sources, such as your advisor and the GSA, is still
important.
