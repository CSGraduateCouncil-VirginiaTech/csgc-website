There are a variety of reading groups in the CS department.
The general idea of a reading group is that you meet regularly (weekly or biweekly) to discuss 1-3 papers on a particular topic.

If you are looking for an advisor, or trying to broaden yourself by reading in a new area, reading groups are a great way to try out research areas.

Here is a list of known reading groups in the department:
