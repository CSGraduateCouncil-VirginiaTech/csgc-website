title: About CS Grad Council
---
The Graduate Council (GC) provides an interface between the CS graduate student body at VT and the faculty members.

We represent the interests of the CS graduate student body both within the department and outside, help organize social events among graduate students, and help incoming students become familiar with departmental procedures and activities. 

Outside the department, we voice student opinions in various graduate school forums and promote social engagements with the wider graduate student community.

Here are some of our activities:
- We organize [events](/events/).
- We allocate travel funds for conference travels, details of which can be found in the page [Travel Funding](/travel_funding/).
