## Departmental funding

The department offers some financial support for CS graduate students to attend conferences.
Requests will be reviewed and (mostly) granted on a rolling basis.
If you submit the survey and don't hear back for a few days, please contact the [Treasurer](/Officers/) by email directly.

See below under "Policy" to see if you qualify.
If so, fill out this [Travel Fund Request Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5SDVLgrrGsBzj25m_ChcLwIUKeVY7qhzA7-c957jbNfxnJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Policy

Our goal is to help support any student who has a refereed paper or
presentation accepted at a conference **once per fiscal year** (July 1
through June 30). The 1st day of your trip defines which fiscal year it
is in.

Requests for support must be submitted via the *Travel Fund Request Form* **before**
the departure date of your travel. Presuming the travel request is approved, a
link to a travel approval form will be provided along with further instructions.

Requests for support for additional trips in a given year, or for
conference attendance without a presentation, will be considered but
not necessarily approved in all cases. Senior PhD students, for whom
multiple trips in a year are common, are more likely to receive multiple
funding awards in a given year.

<s>Due to funding constraints, support levels are limited to
**$400 for travel in the US** and **$600 for international travel**. Getting
support from other sources, such as your advisor and the GSA, is still
important.</s>

**COVID-19 update:** Due to anticipated short-term budget constraints in our department, and since conferences are now in virtual mode due to the pandemic, **the upper limit for conference reimbursements has been lowered to $200**. This policy is expected to be revoked once in-person conferences resume. In the meantime, when needed, please consider additional sources of funding and support, such as your advisor, [TFP](https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/graduatestudentassembly/what-we-can-offer-you/funding-opportunities/travel-fund-program/), or the conference itself.
