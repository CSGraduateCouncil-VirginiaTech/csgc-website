_This page serves as a rough guide for what you (a student) need to do in order to get reimbursed for events you might organize on behalf of the Graduate Student Council._

## <a name="Budget"></a>Budget<a href="#Budget"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Once you have decided to host an event that requires funding, you need to create a budget.
Estimate how many people are going to attend (with some type of survey).
Then estimate the cost of supplies that you will need based on the survey.

Once you have an idea of how many people will attend, create a list of supplies and their costs (a budget).
Send the budget and a request to host the event to [Robert Marcum](mailto:marcumr@cs.vt.edu) *at least a week* before the date of the event.

## <a name="Venue"></a>Venue<a href="#Venue"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

There are a number of rooms available to the CS Department and to grad students in general.
There are various [meeting rooms](https://graduatelifecenter.vt.edu/space-reservations.html) in the GLC available for different group sizes.
The KnowledgeWorks II building in the CRC also has some rooms available, though you may not get many attendees from the main campus.

## <a name="Food"></a>Food<a href="#Food"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

The CS department works with certain establishments in the Blacksburg area (Moe's, Domino's, Papa John's, Jimmy John's, etc).
These places will bill the department directly, meaning you don't have to bother with reimbursements.
However, you can get get food from some other establishment if you so wish.

To be reimbursed, you need the following:
* An itemized receipt of any expenditures, including for silverware, napkins, etc.
* A **signed** list of attendees (nothing fancy, this can just be a legal pad)
* (preferred) some kind of evidence that the event actually took place as planned

* [Teresa Hall](mailto:teresa@vt.edu)

- Send surveys of interest and sign-ups embedded in emails.
  - Sign-up surveys should include:
	    - Email address
      - whether they are remote (NOVA) (need video conferencing)
- Send Google Calendar invitations to the email addresses of those who fill out the sign-up survey.
- Word of mouth works. People don't always read bburg-gradstudents emails.
- Blacksburg-based students cannot email the NOVA list. Ask Dr. Shaffer to propagate emails there.

Buy food for 10 more people than RSVP'd up.

Domino's:
- 18 large pizzas serves 50 people

Drinks:
- Don't keep them in your car all day
- Cans are better than bottles + cups
